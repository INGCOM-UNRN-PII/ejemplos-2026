Refactoring Techniques
Composing Methods

Much of refactoring is devoted to correctly composing methods. In most cases, excessively long methods are the root of all evil. The vagaries of code inside these methods conceal the execution logic and make the method extremely hard to understand—and even harder to change.

The refactoring techniques in this group streamline methods, remove code duplication, and pave the way for future improvements.

    Extract Method
    Inline Method
    Extract Variable
    Inline Temp

    Replace Temp with Query
    Split Temporary Variable
    Remove Assignments to Parameters

    Replace Method with Method Object
    Substitute Algorithm

Moving Features between Objects

Even if you have distributed functionality among different classes in a less-than-perfect way, there is still hope.

These refactoring techniques show how to safely move functionality between classes, create new classes, and hide implementation details from public access.

    Move Method
    Move Field
    Extract Class
    Inline Class

    Hide Delegate
    Remove Middle Man

    Introduce Foreign Method
    Introduce Local Extension

Organizing Data

These refactoring techniques help with data handling, replacing primitives with rich class functionality. Another important result is untangling of class associations, which makes classes more portable and reusable.

    Change Value to Reference
    Change Reference to Value
    Duplicate Observed Data
    Self Encapsulate Field
    Replace Data Value with Object
    Replace Array with Object

    Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional
    Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional
    Encapsulate Field
    Encapsulate Collection
    Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant

    Replace Type Code with Class
    Replace Type Code with Subclasses
    Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
    Replace Subclass with Fields

Simplifying Conditional Expressions

Conditionals tend to get more and more complicated in their logic over time, and there are yet more techniques to combat this as well.

    Consolidate Conditional Expression
    Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
    Decompose Conditional

    Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
    Remove Control Flag
    Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses

    Introduce Null Object
    Introduce Assertion

Simplifying Method Calls

These techniques make method calls simpler and easier to understand. This, in turn, simplifies the interfaces for interaction between classes.

    Add Parameter
    Remove Parameter
    Rename Method
    Separate Query from Modifier
    Parameterize Method

    Introduce Parameter Object
    Preserve Whole Object
    Remove Setting Method
    Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods
    Replace Parameter with Method Call

    Hide Method
    Replace Constructor with Factory Method
    Replace Error Code with Exception
    Replace Exception with Test

Dealing with Generalization

Abstraction has its own group of refactoring techniques, primarily associated with moving functionality along the class inheritance hierarchy, creating new classes and interfaces, and replacing inheritance with delegation and vice versa.

    Pull Up Field
    Pull Up Method
    Pull Up Constructor Body
    Push Down Field
    Push Down Method

    Extract Subclass
    Extract Superclass
    Extract Interface
    Collapse Hierarchy

    Form Template Method
    Replace Inheritance with Delegation
    Replace Delegation with Inheritance
