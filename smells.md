Code Smells

— What? How can code "smell"??
— Well it doesn't have a nose... but it definitely can stink!
Bloaters

Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such gargantuan proportions that they are hard to work with. Usually these smells do not crop up right away, rather they accumulate over time as the program evolves (and especially when nobody makes an effort to eradicate them).

    Long Method
    Large Class

    Primitive Obsession
    Long Parameter List

    Data Clumps

Object-Orientation Abusers

All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles.

    Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

    Refused Bequest
    Switch Statements

    Temporary Field

Change Preventers

These smells mean that if you need to change something in one place in your code, you have to make many changes in other places too. Program development becomes much more complicated and expensive as a result.

    Divergent Change

    Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

    Shotgun Surgery

Dispensables

A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.

    Comments
    Duplicate Code

    Data Class
    Dead Code

    Lazy Class
    Speculative Generality

Couplers

All the smells in this group contribute to excessive coupling between classes or show what happens if coupling is replaced by excessive delegation.

    Feature Envy
    Inappropriate Intimacy

    Incomplete Library Class
    Message Chains

    Middle Man
